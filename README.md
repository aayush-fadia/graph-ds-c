# Graphs in C
## An implementation of a Graph data structure and various algorithms over it in C.
### Uses Adjacency Linked Lists, for both, the Nodes and Edges.
## Implemented Algorithms
### Basics
* Create directed/undirected empty graph
* Add/Delete nodes
* Add/Delete edges
* Free all memory allocated to graph
* Reverse a graph
### Checks
* Strong Connectivity
* Cyclic
### Traversals/Searches
* Depth First
* Breadth First
* Topological
### Path Finding
* Dijkstra's algorithm
* Floyd Warshall algorithm
* All paths between two nodes
